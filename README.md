- Install poetry and create environment.
- Create .env file by env.example.

- Enjoy!

# First Start of application:
- by env.example create .env file
- for creating dropbox variables you need to create app in dropbox and get access token:
  - https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps
  - in your app give permissions for read and write
  - add to .env DROPBOX_APP_KEY=APPKEYHERE
  - add to .env DROPBOX_APP_SECRET=APPSECRETHERE
  - by this link you can get access token, only replace APPKEYHERE with your app key
  - https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=APPKEYHERE&response_type=code&token_access_type=offline
  - in the result you'll get AUTHORIZATIONCODEHERE, replace it in next CURL and run it in terminal:
    curl https://api.dropbox.com/oauth2/token \
      -d code=AUTHORIZATIONCODEHERE \
      -d grant_type=authorization_code \
      -u APPKEYHERE:APPSECRETHERE
  - it will turn you answer in dictionary type, take there refresh token and use it as DROPBOX_REFRESH_TOKEN in .env 
  
- for correct working application on Windows you need to adjust DropBox library:
  - find file: services/file_services.py
  - find function: save_file_dropbox_and_get_new_name 
  - this function save file in dropbox by Django services, but incorrect(it is adding Disc letter (C: or other) to path)
  - so now you know why you need to correct this function
  - on top the same file find import: from storages.backends.dropbox import DropBoxStorage
  - with Ctrl + click on DropBoxStorage you are going to DropBox library 
  - find ~line 115 with next code:
      def _full_path(self, name):
          if name == '/':
              name = ''
          return safe_join(self.root_path, name).replace('\\', '/')
  - and change it to:
      def _full_path(self, name):
          if name == '/':
              name = '' 
          from os.path import join
          final_path = join(self.root_path, name)
          return final_path.replace('\\', '/')
